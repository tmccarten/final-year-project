            <h3>A little about us...</h3>
            <p>Liverpool Pembroke and Sefton H & AC arose from a merger in 1995 of two old Liverpool clubs Pembroke (1890) and Sefton (1889). The club transferred its Track and Field section to the new <strong>Edge Hill University</strong> facilities in 1997. We draw our membership from a wide area but principally Liverpool, Sefton, Knowsley and West Lancashire.</p>

            <p>The club caters for <strong>male and female</strong> athletes from Year 6 pupils and above. There is no requirement for membership other than a determination to train hard and regularly. The club engages in all aspects of the sport:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>cross-country running</li>
              <li>road running</li>
              <li>track and field athletics</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The club competes with distinction in all types of activity including leagues, county, regional, and national championships.</p>

            <p>Members of the club have won numerous individual honours and team titles locally and nationally. Currently several members have achieved international selection that includes <strong>European and Olympic representation.</strong></p>
